# AirBnB-Dashboard-Tableau
While learning about Tableau, I developed this project using reference for guidance. AirBnB-Dashboard-Tableau is a dashboard developed to visualize AirBnB prices in various locations of United States. The dataset used is of the year 2016-2017. The dashboard represents valuable insights to someone looking to buy a property that can be listed on AirBnB.

# Visualization of the Dashboard

## Average Price per Bedrooms
Understanding how property prices fluctuate based on the number of bedrooms can offer valuable insights. This analysis helps estimate a reasonable price for a property by considering its bedroom count. 🏠

## Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings
🔍 This reveals how often properties with a specific number of bedrooms are booked. In this case, properties with a single bedroom receive the most bookings. 🛏️📅

## Price per Zipcode
🌍 It provides a visual representation on a map of the average property prices in specific zipcodes across the United States. 🗺️💵

## Average price by Zipcode
📈 It presents a graph plotting the average property prices for each zipcode in descending order. 🏙️📉

## Revenue for Year(2016)
📅 It indicates the times of the year when property prices are higher and highlights periods with increased booking activity. 📈🏡
